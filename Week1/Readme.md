# Week 1

Getting started, the first thing you need to do is read the 'Introduction.md' file so that you have a basic idea on what you're going to work on.   

## Neural network basics
In this week our main focus is to get you'll started on the journey of Machine Learning and in order to do so you'll will need to have a basic understanding of
the operation of neural networks. The playlist by 3Blue1Brown does a very good job at providing an intuition to what is happening behind the scenes of the grand 
neural networks.

## Building neural networks in raw python
Now, understanding the basics, now its time to implement these in our favourite programming language Python  
Note: We will be using Raw python to do so

## Pytorch
By now, you must have had a good understanding of how neural networks operate, now it's time for you to get familiar with the Pytorch library in Python, which we will be using for most our coding purposes
