# Introduction to GAN
After having your concepts of Neural Networks and OpenCV clear, now it's the time to explore the realm of **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)**. First published in 2014 by Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues, GAN has revolutionized the domain the image generation and sequence predection. The [introductory paper on GAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2661) covers all the math behind the fundamental GAN architecture and gives great insights on how actually GAN manages to generate images so magically.
