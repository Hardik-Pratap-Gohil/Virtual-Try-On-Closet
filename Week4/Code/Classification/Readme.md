# Imagge Clasification using LeNet CNN

This notebook demonstrates how to build and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on the LeNet architecture for image classification tasks.  

## Overview
The LeNet architecture, proposed by Yann LeCun et al., is one of the pioneering convolutional neural networks designed for handwritten and machine-printed character recognition tasks. This notebook walks through the process of:
- **Loading and Preprocessing the Data**: Preparing the dataset for training and testing using MNIST dataset
- **Defining the LeNet Model**: Building the CNN architecture.
- **Training the Model**: Training the CNN on the dataset.
- **Evaluating the Model**: Assessing the performance of the trained model.
- **Making Predictions**: Using the trained model to classify new images.
