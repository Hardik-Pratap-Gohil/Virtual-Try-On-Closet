# Week2

In this week, we will learn how to use the OpenCV library for using camera and various image processing tasks.   

## OpenCV Python Tutorial

We will be following an OpenCV tutorial video series by "Tech with Tim". This is the link to the series: [OpenCV Python tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCR2Weh64h4&list=PLzMcBGfZo4-lUA8uGjeXhBUUzPYc6vZRn&index=1).  

You are expected to know numpy basics. If you are not familiar with Numpy library or want to explore more functionalities, an ipynb file has been uploaded in the code section to get you started

The content of this tutorial series is as follows:
- Introduction and Images
- Image Fundamentals and Manipulation
- Cameras and VideoCapture
- Drawing on Images
- Colour Detection
- Corner Detection
- Template Matching
- Face and Eye Detection


  The relevant code with comments has been uploaded to the code folder of this week.  

  You can also refer to the [opencv docmentation](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/index.html) for reference purposes

  
  This week will end with an assignment in which you are supposed to make a Document Scanner using OpenCV. The details of the assignment are in the assignment folder
